                    <ul>I am currently learning Python, C#, SQL, HTML, and CSS. In the future, I want to study C++ 
                        because I am interested in video game design and programming. I have taken three programming 
                        classes based in Python. This language was my original frame of reference for programming.</ul>

            <h3>C#</h3>
            <div id="csharp-info">
                <ul>C# was the next language I studied. It is quite different from Python in terms of syntax, 
                    but I found that to be the easier part to learn. I began learning C# in a class called 
                    "Programming with Classes." It taught me about using class objects. 
                    Python does not naturally use classes, so I was glad to have this opportunity.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    My final project in the class was to create a video game. I created an arcade-style game called "Medic"
                    in which you play as a blue square. As the medic, you have to avoid the red-colored "enemy" squares 
                    which lose you points and "save" the green-colored "civilian" squares which
                    gain you points. I also implemented a yellow power-up square, which makes you invulnerable 
                    to the effects of the enemies. You acquire an enemy for each level you gain. If your score
                    becomes zero or less, you lose the game. The goal is to see how many levels you can survive
                    before dying.
                </ul>
