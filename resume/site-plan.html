      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m a Computer Science student. I work with computers and programming 
          languages on a daily basis. I need a website to display my personal 
          work, so that companies I interview with can see the projects I have 
          worked on in addition to my resume. Companies will want to see my website 
          of personal work to have a more concrete awareness of my skills. Do you 
          need more female programmers? You can learn all about my skills from my 
          personal work website.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is made up of creative, curious people who want to explore 
          the world around them and solve the great puzzle of logic and life. 
          The work of computer programming is an exercise in problem-solving, 
          patience, and discipline. Like all great skills, though, there is a 
          dash of fun there if you look for it. The audience I want to serve is 
          looking for this dash of fun in every program they create. This is 
          your work. Find joy in it.

        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site through a link from my digital resume. They will learn about the projects I have completed and the extent of my programming skills. My site should show them that I am a hard worker and an avid learner. 
        The logo will probably be my face.
        Information about me: name, age, I’m pursuing a Computer Science degree.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        Languages I’m learning: Python, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript. The languages I want to study in the future should also be included
        I have taken three programming classes based in Python. This language was my original frame of reference for practical programming. 
        C# was the next language I studied. It is quite different from Python in terms of syntax, but that was the easy part to learn. I took this C# class in order to learn about using class objects. Classes are easier to use and learn about in terms of C-languages compared to Python. 
        One python project will be my choose-your-own-adventure story-game. The C#-project will be the arcade-style computer game I built. 
        A list of classes I’ve taken to this point would make sense to be included: 
        Year 1: CS 101 Introduction to Programming (Python), CSE 170 Technical Teamwork, ECEN 106 Computer Systems, CSE111 Programming with Functions (Python), CSE 210 Programming with Classes, CSE 180 Algorithmic Thinking, CIT 111 Introduction to Databases
        Year 2: WDD 130 Web Fundamentals, CSE 212 Programming with Data Structures, CSE 121B JavaScript Language, CSE 280 Discrete Mathematics, CIT 225 Database Design and Development

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        My personal site will also include links to my other professional social media profiles, such as LinkedIn. 
        There will also be a link to my FaceBook because employers are known for checking potential employees’ FaceBook posts.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The blank rectangles will be paragraph text. I simply found it easier to symbolize this with blank rectangles than to use actual text boxes.
